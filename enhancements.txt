It also incorporates collaboration with cross-functional teams, aligning with the JD's requirement for teamwork and communication. The existing bullet point \"Built and deployed full-stack features using React and MongoDB on AWS, for SAP’s Bydesign module\" provides the basis for this enhanced description, adding leadership and quantifiable impact.","priority":"critical"},{"type":"rephrase","target_section":"SUMMARY","original_text_snippet":"Software Engineer with 2.5+ years of experience building distributed backend systems and deploying scalable cloud solutions.","suggested_text":"Full-Stack Software Engineer with experience building and deploying scalable, distributed backend systems and user-centric frontend applications using React, JavaScript, and related technologies.","reasoning":"The JD emphasizes \"Fullstack Developer\" as a core requirement.

The additions and rephrasing strengthen the candidate's profile by highlighting relevant skills and experience, especially in full-stack development and the specific technologies required by the role.  While the candidate still has slightly less than the desired 3+ years of experience, the changes made improve their chances of being considered.  The candidate should be prepared to discuss the newly added skills during interviews and potentially demonstrate their knowledge through small projects or examples.","llm_model_used":"gemini-2.5-pro"}
